### About Metis

Metis is an open source and highly robust JSON distributed database / storage solution capable of functionality such as:

1. Incredibly fast multi-node and multi-file IO that extends across both local and remote clusters.

2. Robust multi-node replication with optional automated backup.

3. Easy migration from existing database solutions such as MySQL to Metis.

4. Javascript /Typescript implementation with zero dependencies (*such as jQuery*) that also brings support for Cordova / PhoneGap applications, Chrome / Chrome OS applications, and modern browsers (with HTML5 LocalStorage).
