# Overview

Metis is an open source and highly robust JSON distributed database / storage solution. This charm will install Metis in /var/www/Metis.

# Installation

To deploy this charm, you will need at least: an http server (whether it be apache or nginx) that has access to executing PHP, a working Juju installation and a successful bootstrap. Once bootstrapped, deploy the Metis charm by doing:
	juju deploy metis

And now expose the service:
	juju expose metis

All done! You've now deployed Metis on your juju system
