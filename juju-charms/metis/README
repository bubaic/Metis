# Overview

Metis is an open source and highly robust JSON distributed database / storage solution. This charm will install Metis in /var/www/Metis.

# Installation / Deploying

## Requirements

To deploy this charm, you will need at least: an http server (whether it be apache or nginx) that has access to executing PHP, a working Juju installation and a successful bootstrap.

## Initial Configuration

By default, Metis will download / check for dependencies relating to nginx. If you are wanting to deploy Metis on an apache server, modify the config.yaml engine to "apache2".

## Deploying

Once bootstrapped and you have modified the configuration if necessary, deploy the Metis charm by doing:
	juju deploy metis

When you deploy Metis, it will:

- Check if nginx or apache2 is installed. If not, it will automatically download nginx.
- Check if the necessary PHP libraries are installed (primarily php5 and php5 CURL). If not, it will automatically download those dependencies.
- Download the latest Metis version from https://github.com/StroblIndustries/Metis as well as it's dependency AtlasUI Web Framework (https://github.com/JoshStrobl/AtlasUI) and install those in /var/www/AtlasUI and /var/www/Metis.

## Detailed Configuration

Before exposing Metis, you will need to modify the nodeList.json file in /var/www/Metis as well as create the necessary folders in /var/www/Metis/data. You can read more about setting up Metis at https://github.com/StroblIndustries/Metis/wiki/Setting-Up-Metis

# Exposing Metis

After you have modified the nodeList.json file and created the necessary folders within /var/www/Metis/data/, you are welcome to expose the Metis service by doing the following:
	juju expose metis

All done! You've now deployed Metis on your juju system
