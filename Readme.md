Metis is an open source JSON distributed database with the **goal** of being a highly robust file-based database / storage solution capable of necessary functionality such as:

1. Incredibly fast, non-blocking, file IO

2. Robust multi-node replication

3. Support for commonly used protocols, such as HTTP and FTP

4. Multi-node oriented file fetching

5. Multi-node and multi-file SQL-like query capability for writing and fetching data from files.

Metis uses a toolkit known as [AtlasUI Web Framework](https://github.com/JoshStrobl/AtlasUI "AtlasUI Web Framework"), so remember that prior to using Metis, to grab the
latest AtlasUI. As both Metis and AtlasUI Web Framework are considered rolling releases, we will be periodically be taking snapshots of stable builds.
