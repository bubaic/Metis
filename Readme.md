## About Metis

Metis is an open source and highly robust JSON distributed database / storage solution capable of functionality such as:

1. Incredibly fast multi-node and multi-file IO that extends across both local and remote clusters.

2. Robust multi-node replication with optional automated backup.

3. Easy migration from existing database solutions such as MySQL to Metis.

4. Typescript / Javascript implementation with zero dependencies (*such as jQuery*).

## Getting Started

It is easy for you to get started using Metis. We try to keep the [documentation](https://github.com/StroblIndustries/Metis/wiki) updated, so consider it a reliable source for learning Metis, looking into changes with versions, etc.

You can get started by [setting up Metis](https://github.com/StroblIndustries/Metis/wiki/Setting-Up-Metis) and utilizing [file IO functions](https://github.com/StroblIndustries/Metis/wiki/File-IO).
